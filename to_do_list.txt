Missing features:
On the channel generator:
    -Bounding box is only in x-y direction. Needs to be updated to support movement over any direction.
Comm Channels:
    -Doppler for communication channels
    -TX/RX FoV is not utilized - define it for communication channels
        LOS recalculation after array angle limitation - Currently, the LOS per path data is not available - regenerate .mat files from WI output with this data
    -I'm disabling array rotation - the current num_activate_users by rotation array may not be sufficient for the number of users with channels available.
        The generator now takes only the rotation of the first element.
    -How to present the channels by ID? This still seems like a question to be resolved
 
 Radar:
    -TX/RX FoV is defined as an internal parameter. Add it to the parameters file.
 
 Joint:
    -Read_raytracing - I've added a comm/radar indicator for now, however, 
        ideally we want have activate_user activate_basestation etc. for an radar/comm agnostic code.
    -Merge validate_params and validate_radar_params by adding an input to the function (i.e., default parameter location)
        I'm not sure if anything is different here
    -Validate params - list of ignored fields for not exists warning.
        There fields need to be removed from the default parameters.

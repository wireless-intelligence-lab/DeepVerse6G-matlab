DeepMIMO fix..

Shorten .basestation .user ..

Shall we fix the ordering of the BSs? 
- fix bsi-bs{i} problem

Similarly, we may have user/BS/additional Lidars. Will be better to carry outside.
- Put them into the outside structure.

Cameras do not necessarily belong to the basestations.
- Put them into the outside structure.

How to accomodate dynamic/static users?
-.SUE/.DUE? This fixes all the problems.
Trajectory data would have the dynamic only. 

Cleaning - remove WV change to DV

Default parameter support

Still single/multifile parameter structure
- Both may be supported? 

Update LoS status..
